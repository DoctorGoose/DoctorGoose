            <h2>Stopping At The Beginning</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my journey exploring the effects of L-theanine on cognitive health and brain activity!</p>

            
<h2><strong>L-Theanine?</h2></strong>
<p><a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine” target=”_blank”>L-theanine</a> is a compound that, although not produced by the human body and not essential, has garnered attention for alterations in mood, stress management, reaction time, focus, and psychological state of humans. 
<a href=”https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464611000351

<a href=” https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/66/2/82/1863235
” target=”_blank”>3</a>. Predominantly found in green and black tea, as well as in some mushroom varieties, L-theanine is renowned for its ability to promote relaxation without sedation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified L-theanine as “generally recognized as safe.” 
<a href=”https://www.cfsanappsexternal.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/index.cfm?set=GrASNotices&id=209
” target=”_blank”>4</a>. This designation suggests a high safety profile when used according to the product’s guidelines. However, it's important to note that this status is based on current knowledge and research, which is still evolving. Consultation with a healthcare provider is crucial before starting L-theanine or any supplement. As L-theanine is not a medication, there are no standardized dosing guidelines. It is commonly available in 200-mg caplets or tablets. The lack of official dosing guidelines underscores the importance of consulting with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Medical advice disclosure out of the way, I'll be testing with 200mg caplets, which are identical to some Magnesium caplets. This will come back during the Study Design phase. This blog series will explore my personal experience with L-theanine, examining its effects on cognitive health and brain activity. 

L-Theanine has been celebrated for its potential to enhance cognitive abilities and mental clarity. Anecdotally, many report improved focus, reduced anxiety, and a sense of calm without the drowsiness often associated with relaxation aids. It has been investigated for anxiety, sleep, stress management, high blood pressure, Parkinsons, depression, and schizophrenia <a href=”https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2019.104395” target=”_blank”>5</a>,
<a href=”https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2019.104478” target=”_blank”>6</a>,
<a href=”https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fshw.2021.12.004” target=”_blank”>7</a>.  I've already noticed increased focus, reduced heart rate, and overall calm.
<strong<> Mechanisms:</strong<>
Research suggests L-theanine may alter brain wave patterns, particularly increasing alpha waves, which are associated with relaxed alertness. Additionally, L-theanine is thought to modulate aspects of brain function, potentially influencing neurotransmitters like GABA, dopamine, and serotonin <a href=”https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-011-2440-z” target=”_blank”>8</a>. It is a glutamate derivative, and thus has high affinity for glutamatergic receptors <a href=”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10802/” target=”_blank”>9</a> like NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate). 

<h2><strong<>Motivation for Madness:</strong></h2>
<p>Given the buzz around L-theanine, I'm inspired to explore its effects firsthand. To ensure an unbiased approach, I'm initiating a washout period, ceasing L-theanine intake to reset my system to baseline. Post-washout, I'll be supplementing with 200mg caplets while monitoring changes using EEG for an objective measure of brain activity. This experiment isn't just about personal curiosity; it's about adding a data-driven narrative to the anecdotal evidence surrounding L-theanine. I admittedly started taking it like any other supplement, expecting no noticeable benefits - the dramatic change is what prompted me to step back and evaluate from first principles. </p>

<h2><strong<>One the Next Episode</strong></h2>
<p>Join me on this intriguing journey as I document my experiences and discoveries. Future blog entries will cover the EEG construction, mental baselines, brain activity signal analysis, and pharmacokinetic models to develop improved supplementation recommendations. </p>
